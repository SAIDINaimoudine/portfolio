I made this portfolio because as a junior dev, i need to show people my work but also to showcase my skills. I built it with Reactjs because I want to work with React and become a full-stack javascript developer.
With this project, I got a first glance on how to build a React app, configure eslint and test your code with vitest & react testing library.
